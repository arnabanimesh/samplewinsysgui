# Rust for Windows demo app
Implemented [C/C++ Win32 API tutorials | Windows GUI Programming "windows.h"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzp0Bbyy_3i750dsUj7yq4JrPOIUR_NK) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using [Rust for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/rust-for-windows)

Preferred `windows-sys` crate as opposed to `windows` crate for lightweight app creation and faster compilation times
